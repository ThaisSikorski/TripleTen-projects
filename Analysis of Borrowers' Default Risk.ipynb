    "To summarize, we began by verifying the dataset, noting the initial presence of 12 columns and 21,525 rows. Upon checking for missing values in the columns, we identified the presence of missing values in the 'days_employed' and 'total_income' columns. Additionally, in the 'days_employed' column, we observed negative values and excessively high numbers of days worked, which seemed inconsistent with realistic expectations.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the 'total_income' column, the values appeared to be extremely high, which we further investigated throughout the study. Furthermore, during the initial analysis, we noticed the need for standardizing the writing in the 'education' column and flagged anomalies such as -1 and 20 in the 'children' column, as well as 0 in the 'dob_years' column, which seemed unusual. Continuing the analysis, we found that the missing values were symmetrical not only because the number of rows in the filtered table was the same for both the 'total_income' and 'days_employed' columns but also because the missing data was present in both columns simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "During the data transformation, we concluded the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- In the 'education' column, the spelling was not standardized due to it being an open text field, which was corrected.\n",
    "- In the 'dob_years' column, the presence of the value 0 likely occurred because some individuals chose not to disclose their age. We corrected this error by using the median and replacing these values.\n",
    "- In the 'gender' column, a similar situation occurred, where individuals might not have identified as F or M and entered a different value. Since it was a unique value, we resolved it by replacing it with TRUE.\n",
    "- In the 'children' column, errors likely occurred due to incorrect data entry. To correct this, we replaced the values -1 and 20 with 1 and 2.\n",
    "- In the 'days_employed' column, issues may have arisen due to technical problems. To enhance the study, we treated the values to be absolute and not negative.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regarding the missing values, we believe that due to the table not having a unique identifier for each customer, the rows with missing values were actually duplicate records when filling out the 'purpose' column, which was an open text field.\n",
    "\n",
    "About the 72 duplicate entries found, we decided to remove them from the dataset due to their low incidence, removing the rows that contained duplicate information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike the duplicate data, missing values were treated differently since simply eliminating them could disrupt the analysis and study results. To address this, we used the median method to fill in the missing values in the dataset, ensuring a more robust analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "To assist in calculating values for the total_income column, we categorized the age column and created a new column called age_category. Considering the factors on which income generally depends and understanding that the data contains significant outliers, we used median values to replace those missing.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a similar approach to restoring data in the previous column, we were able to restore values in the 'days_employed' column using a function to calculate medians based on the identified parameter - income_type. The median was used because the median values of the income_type for the customer sufficiently described the typical values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, to aid in the final conclusions, we categorized the purpose and total_income columns. We chose these columns so that we could better visualize the table and thus analyze the types of loans and income classes more effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regarding the hypotheses, we conclude:\n",
    "- Those who have fewer children are more likely to pay their debts on time, unlike those who have more children.\n",
    "- About the marital status and timely payments, the probability of those in a civil partnership and singles defaulting on their loans is higher compared to those with other marital statuses. Additionally, widows are less likely to default.\n",
    "- Individuals from higher economic classes are more likely to default.\n",
    "- Lastly, the purpose of credit affects default rates."
